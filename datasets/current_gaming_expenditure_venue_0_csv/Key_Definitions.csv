,"EGM Numbers: Average number of operating EGM's at the gaming venue during the month. This figure is consistent with the average entitlement applied to the EGM as per tax calculation.
Gaming Machine Density calculations beyond 2013 are based on EGM numbers divided by adult population divided by 1,000 (gaming machines per 1,000 adults). 
Expenditure / EGM: Refers to the average Expenditure per Gaming Machine. From 2013, these figures are based on net expenditures divided by EGM Numbers. 
SEIFA Scores: a lower score indicates that an area is relatively disadvantaged compared to an area with a higher score. Scores should only be used in distributive analysis. Rankings are based on highest score, for example 1st ranking in index of disadvantage means the LGA is least disadvantaged.
Disclaimer: Care must be taken in using any figures for an LGA involving net expenditure and population. The expenditure per person in an LGA may include an amount of expenditure coming from persons not living within the LGA.
